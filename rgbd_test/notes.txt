I added a normalization to depth which seems to help 
img = Float32.(img)
dt = fit(UnitRangeTransform, img)
new = StatsBase.transform(dt, img)

There is a opreobleme with depth data. it is very un precise
how can I make the most of it?
some sugested to smoth the holes in the data with some filters on the picture
